## What Is IP Network Fiber?

**IP network fiber** refers to the use of fiber optic cabling and fiber-enabled networking equipment to transport Internet Protocol (IP) data traffic. Unlike traditional copper-based Ethernet, fiber optic networks transmit data as light signals, enabling higher speeds, longer distances, and superior reliability for LAN, MAN, and WAN architectures.
